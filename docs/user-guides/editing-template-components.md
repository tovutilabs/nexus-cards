# User Guide: Editing Template Components

## Introduction

Your business card template now uses **editable components** instead of fixed layouts. This means you can customize each section of your card independently while keeping the beautiful template design.

## What Are Components?

Components are the building blocks of your card. Each component represents a section:

- **Profile Component**: Your name, photo, job title, and company
- **Contact Component**: Phone, email, website, and location
- **Social Links Component**: LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, and other social media

## How to Edit Components

### Step 1: Go to Your Card

1. Log in to your Nexus Cards dashboard
2. Click on your business card
3. Click the **Customize** button

### Step 2: Open the Components Tab

On the customize page, you'll see several tabs at the top:
- Styling
- **Components** ← Click here
- Settings

### Step 3: Find Your Template Components

You'll see a list of all components on your card. Template components are marked with a badge showing which template they belong to (e.g., "Basic Business").

### Step 4: Edit a Component

Click the ⚙️ icon next to any component to edit it. You can:

**Profile Component**:
- Show/hide your avatar (profile photo)
- Show/hide your job title
- Show/hide your company name
- Show/hide your bio
- Change avatar shape (circle, square, rounded)
- Change avatar size (small, medium, large)

**Contact Component**:
- Show/hide phone number

**Social Links Component**:
- Change the section title (e.g., "Connect With Me")
- Choose which social platforms to show
- Add or remove platforms (LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube)

### Step 5: Reorder Components

Use the ↑ and ↓ arrows to change the order of components on your card.

**Example**: Move your Contact section above your Social Links section.

### Step 6: Enable/Disable Components

Use the toggle switch next to each component to show or hide it on your card.

**Example**: Hide the Social Links component if you don't use social media for business.

### Step 7: Preview Your Changes

As you edit components, the live preview on the right updates instantly. You can see exactly how your card will look.

### Step 8: Save Your Card

Click the **Save** button at the top of the page to publish your changes.

## Tips & Tricks

### Keep Your Template's Design

### Test Before Publishing

Always preview your changes before saving. The live preview shows exactly how your card will look to visitors.

### Mobile-Friendly

All components automatically adjust for mobile devices. You don't need to do anything special.

### Undo Changes

If you don't like a change:
1. Click the ⚙️ icon again
2. Change the setting back
3. Click Save

Or use your browser's back button before saving to discard all changes.
